                                <p>Morgath is a savage and fearsome leader. He is driven by vengeance after his tribe and family were destroyed by an orc warlord. During the final confrontation with the warlord, Morgath brutally killed him, but not before the orc killed his wife and child. This rage fuels his relentless pursuit of power and protection over those he loves. The Twisted Fang follows him not only for his strength but because he has saved each of them from their haunted pasts.</p>
                                <p>Special Trait: Morgath is blessed by the gods with secrets that not even he knows. He is a powerful, nearly unbreakable front-line warrior. </p>
                                <p>Morgath found all the members of the Twisted Fang haunted by tragic pasts and accepted them without judgment. The group chose him as their leader because of his acceptance of them and his ability to unify them under one banner.</p>

                                <p>Kaelithor is the twin brother of Elowen. After his resurrection, he vowed to stay by her side and protect her. He is a master tracker and skilled with a bow. His connection to the forest remains strong, though it is tainted by the memories of the tragedy that destroyed their homeland.</p>
                                <p>Special Trait: Kaelithor excels in ranged combat, using his keen senses to track enemies and execute deadly attacks.</p>
                                <p>Morgath saved both Kaelithor and Elowen, and Kaelithor follows him out of respect for his ability to unify them.</p>

                                <p>Elowen once believed she was protecting the forest, but a demon disguised as the forest’s protector deceived her. She performed forbidden magic using rare herbs collected by her brother, Kaelithor, which unleashed a deadly plague that destroyed the forest. To stop the plague, she killed her brother. The villagers sacrificed themselves to resurrect him, believing the twins, born under a full moon, were children of prophecy. Now, she seeks redemption by protecting her new family, the Twisted Fang, and restoring balance.</p>
                                <p>Special Trait: Elowen is a master of druidic magic, using both support and battlefield control abilities to guide the group.</p>
                                <p>Elowen was saved by Morgath after the loss of her family and forest. She follows him with loyalty and aims to never fail her new family.</p>

                                <p>Thragar once worshipped the orc god of battle, but when he refused to kill innocents, the god betrayed him. Thragar attempted to help the innocents escape but was caught. He was forced to kill those he tried to save or watch his family be tortured. This led him into a spiral of despair, where he was enslaved by his own people. After escaping, he encountered Morgath, who helped him find new purpose.</p>
                                <p>Special Trait: As a paladin of vengeance, Thragar seeks justice and redemption, using his divine powers to smite enemies.</p>
                                <p>Morgath saved Thragar from his torment, offering him a new path as a protector of the weak.</p>

                                <p>Vestra was once an elf who was kidnapped by a short-lived species that sought to unlock the secret of her long lifespan. After years of torture and experimentation, she was killed, but the experiments transformed her into a shade. In a fit of rage, she reanimated her captors, repeatedly killing them until consumed by grief. She entered the Shadowfell to master her powers, returning to the mortal realm without purpose until Morgath accepted her.</p>
                                <p>Special Trait: Vestra can control vast numbers of undead, making her a formidable force in battles.</p>

Every time she tried to escape, the crime lord tortured her family in front of her. After her family was killed, she attempted to take her own life in a bombing but was saved by the Twisted Fang. Now, she uses her skills to protect the group and takes pleasure in silently eliminating their enemies.</p>

                        <h1>The Kara Connection</h1>
                        <h2>The Forge Master</h2>
                        <p>
                            Kara, the Forge Master, is a strong, independent woman in her early thirties, with long, braided red hair and piercing emerald green eyes that shimmer with intensity. Years of working at the forge have shaped her into a muscular and skilled blacksmith, known throughout the region for her legendary craftsmanship. Her forge is not only renowned for producing high-quality weapons and armor but also serves as a hub for many adventurers and townsfolk who trust her implicitly. Kara’s work is not just her profession—it’s her passion. She approaches every project, whether it’s a simple tool or a masterfully crafted weapon, with a fiery dedication that mirrors the flames of her forge.


                            Kara is deeply, profoundly in love with Morgath. Her affection for him goes beyond admiration—it’s a fierce and unwavering love that she holds close to her heart, guarding it like one of her most precious treasures. Though she hides this depth of feeling behind a flirtatious demeanor, it’s a veil she wears only for him, teasing him lightly in a way that no one else ever experiences. Her flirtations are subtle, warm, and always infused with a tenderness she can’t completely conceal.



                            Beneath her playful words lies an intensity she dares not reveal fully, fearing it might change their bond or disrupt the group. Yet, her love for him is undeniable, present in every piece of armor she crafts and every glance she steals when he’s not looking. Kara’s heart belongs to Morgath entirely, and she continues to nurture that love quietly, hoping that one day he might notice the sincerity hidden behind her flirtatious smiles and see her as more than a friend.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Her Connection to the Twisted Fang </h2>
                        <p>
                            Kara has a deep bond with each member of the Twisted Fang. As their trusted blacksmith, she has personally forged, repaired, and improved many of their weapons and armor. Beyond the professional relationship, Kara is a close friend to each of them, sharing moments of camaraderie and bonding that go beyond the anvil and the adventurers’ gear. She has seen them grow from a ragtag band of adventurers into a formidable and respected group.



                            Each member of the Twisted Fang sees Kara as more than just a blacksmith. To them, she is a confidante and a steady presence—a person they turn to when they need reassurance or grounding after the chaos of battle. Elowen often seeks her wisdom, discussing how the natural world and crafted weapons can coexist. Thragar respects her strength and discipline, feeling a kinship in their shared sense of honor. Nim enjoys playful banter with Kara, seeing her as someone who helps her find strength in her small stature. Kaelithor values her pragmatic advice, and Vestra silently respects her discipline, seeing a reflection of herself in Kara’s unwavering focus.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Her Inner Struggle </h2>
                        <p>Kara’s feelings are amplified by her interactions with Elara, the orphan she recently adopted. Elara looks up to Morgath as a father figure, and this bond only strengthens Kara’s emotions. Watching Morgath interact with the child, showing a softer side that few others ever see, makes Kara feel as though they are already a family in some sense. The way Elara sees Morgath as the father she never had resonates deeply with Kara’s own unspoken desire to share her life with him. </p>
                        <p>Kara is fiercely independent and not the type to rely on others, but when it comes to Morgath, she finds herself wishing for something more—something she’s afraid to admit even to herself. There’s an undercurrent of tension every time they are alone, and Kara waits for the right moment to reveal her heart. She has confided in Elara, who has noticed the way Kara looks at Morgath, and who secretly hopes to push Kara toward revealing her feelings when the time is right. Kara will not express her feelings until great peril befalls Morgath, then she will tell him how she feels! </p>
                        <p>Despite this, Kara continues to wait, unsure of how Morgath truly feels. She has convinced herself that he sees her only as a friend and ally, but deep down, she hopes that he might feel the same way. Kara believes that once the current storm of battles and missions passes, there might be a moment when she can finally tell him how she feels—perhaps even by the fire of the forge where their connection first began. </p>
                        <p>For now, she remains a steadfast supporter of the Twisted Fang, keeping her emotions in check, waiting for the right moment when she can finally reveal the depth of her love for Morgath. </p>
                        <h1>Missions</h1>
                        <h2>Orc Stronghold Quest</h2>

                        <h3>Mission Overview</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Objective: The Twisted Fang was tasked with assaulting an orc stronghold that had been terrorizing nearby villages. The orcs were well-defended, but the Twisted Fang devised a strategic approach to dismantle them.</li>
                            <li>Location: A large orc encampment fortified deep in the mountains.</li>
                            <li>Preparation: The group spent several days scouting the orcs, identifying weaknesses in their patrols and routines. They observed that the orcs were feasting regularly, making it an ideal opportunity for poisoning.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Execution of the Plan</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Nim snuck into the camp, successfully poisoning the orcs’ ale, ensuring that when the Twisted Fang attacked, the orcs would be weakened. She rolled high on her stealth checks, avoiding detection and setting the plan in motion.</li>
                            <li>Morgath led the attack, using the distraction of the poisoned orcs to launch a frontal assault while Kaelithor and Nim flanked the camp from the rear, eliminating key sentries.</li>
                            <li>Elowen and Vestra used their magic to control the battlefield, with Elowen casting spells to entangle and slow down the orcs, while Vestra reanimated fallen enemies to use against their own comrades.</li>
                            <li>The 30 undead orcs that Vestra controlled were instrumental in overwhelming the orc defenses. They acted as both shock troops and decoys, drawing attention away from the Twisted Fang’s tactical strikes.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Final Confrontation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Morgath personally faced off against the Orc Warlord who had betrayed Thragar. In a brutal one-on-one battle, Morgath’s strength and fury were too much for the warlord, who was ultimately captured rather than killed. Morgath knew the warlord had valuable information about other strongholds in the region.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The orc stronghold was destroyed, and the Twisted Fang looted the camp. They found:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Weapons and armor that were later sold to Kara, the Forge Master.</li>
                                <li>Gems and precious metals that Nim negotiated to sell at the Merchants Guild.</li>
                                <li>Livestock and trade goods, which were donated to local villages to improve their relations with the Twisted Fang.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Dire Wolf Encounter</h2>
                        <h3>Initial Setup</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Location: Western fields outside the woods, where dire wolves had been attacking livestock.</li>
                            <li>Bait: 5 purchased chickens were used to lure in the dire wolves.</li>
                            <li>Undead Positioning: 30 undead orcs were stationed outside the trap to encircle the wolves once they approached.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Dire Wolf Arrival</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elowen identified 10 dire wolves approaching the trap.</li>
                            <li>Vestra signaled the undead to encircle the wolves as they took the bait.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Initial Attack (Focus on the Alpha)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Morgath led the attack by focusing on the alpha wolf, calling for the party to do the same.</li>
                            <li>The undead were commanded to attack the other wolves while the members of the Twisted Fang attacked the alpha.</li>
                            <li>Kaelithor targeted the alpha with ranged attacks, while Nim attempted a stealthy approach.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Twisted Fang Attack Rolls</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Morgath rolled well, delivering a solid blow to the alpha.</li>
                            <li>Nim and Kaelithor both scored effective hits on the wolves.</li>
                            <li>The 30 undead orcs rolled for their attacks on the remaining wolves, hitting them with moderate success but not enough to kill the entire pack.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Healing and Continued Attack</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The wolves retaliated, wounding some members of the party.</li>
                            <li>Elowen began casting healing spells on the severely injured party members, using d6 rolls to determine healing effectiveness. Any roll over 3 resulted in a full heal.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Capturing the Alpha</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once the alpha was weakened, Morgath gave the order to capture it alive.</li>
                            <li>The undead continued their assault on the remaining wolves while the party focused on subduing the alpha.</li>
                            <li>Elowen used her restraining spells to bind the alpha, successfully holding it in place.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Morgath’s Bond with the Alpha (Ragnarok)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Morgath attempted to forge a bond with the dire wolf alpha by touching its head and invoking the powers that had resurrected him.</li>
                            <li>He spoke to the wolf, telling stories of his past, including the loss of his wife and son, which deeply affected the Twisted Fang members. Each had a personal reaction to hearing this, showing emotions of sympathy, shock, and a deeper respect for Morgath.</li>
                            <li>The alpha wolf was named Ragnarok after the bond was successfully forged.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Healing Ragnarok</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elowen used a healing spell on Ragnarok, rolling a d6. Since the result was over 3, it resulted in a full heal for the dire wolf, solidifying the bond between Morgath and his new companion.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Butchering the Wolves</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The remaining dire wolves were butchered and skinned:</li>
                            <li>Pelts: 2 excellent pelts, 5 common pelts, 3 poor pelts.</li>
                            <li>Meat: The total amount of dire wolf meat collected was 630 pounds, enough to feed the Twisted Fang for 15 days, with the rest available for sale.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Heading to the Outpost</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The party mounted their horses, and Morgath rode Ragnarok as they traveled to the nearest outpost.</li>
                            <li>They brought with them:</li>
                            <li>5 silver rings</li>
                            <li>1 golden ring</li>
                            <li>A large sack of gemstones</li>
                            <li>10 dire wolf pelts (2 excellent, 5 common, 3 poor)</li>
                            <li>450 pounds of fresh dire wolf meat</li>
                            <li>2 strong young horses in peak condition</li>
                            <li>Nim was tasked with negotiating the best price for these items.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Bandit Encounter</h2>
                        <h3>Scouting the Bandit Camp</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After arriving at the bandits’ location, Nim and Kaelithor scouted ahead to assess the situation.</li>
                            <li>The camp had several sloppy sentries, with 15 bandits total.</li>

                            <li>As the battle progressed, the dark creatures began making strange noises, almost like chanting.</li>
                            <li>The chanting seemed to be part of a dark ritual to summon more corruption or cause greater harm.</li>

                            <li>The party rolled agility checks and, luckily, all members passed without being stunned.</li>
                            <li>Elowen then cast Thunderwave, damaging the remaining creatures significantly.</li>
